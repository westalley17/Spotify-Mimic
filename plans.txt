1. Create an account (check for uniqueness).
2. Login to account (using a process similar to program 3 from 1310)
3. Once logged in, display menu of options to choose from that include: (include their name and welcome them to the Spotify Mimic)
    - Print entire song list so that the user can choose which songs to add to their own playlist.
    - Enter their playlist (Spotify uses a library with multiple playlist opportunities, but for the sake of simplicity we will only have one playlist).
        - Once in the playlist, they will have a queue of songs ready for them in the default ordering of the playlist (simply the order that they added them in, just like Spotify works).
        - In this option, the user will be allowed to change the ordering of the queue by manually selecting songs from THEIR playlist to jump the line.
          (just... like... Spotify... get it yet?)
        - They will finally need an option to return to the main menu.
    - Save their playlist to a unique text file only for that user.
    - Saving this playlist here will be the "default" queue until the playlist gets changed.
    - Exit the application.

Figure out the shuffling technique!
